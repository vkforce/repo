>**Problem Statement**: Building a Habit Tracker in Golang
>*Problem*: People often struggle to form and maintain new habits. Keeping track of progress and visualizing consistency can be a powerful motivator. However, existing habit tracker applications might not be readily available or offer the desired level of customization.

Solution: Develop a simple, command-line based habit tracker application in Golang that allows users to:

Create new habits with descriptive names.
Mark habits as completed for specific dates.
View a history of completed habits for a specified period.
(Optional) Set reminders for habit completion (using libraries or system notifications).
This project will help you solidify core Golang concepts like:

Variables and data structures (habits, dates)
User input and validation
Control flow statements (loops, conditionals)
Working with dates and times
File I/O for persistent data storage (optional)
Step-by-Step Implementation:

Define Habit Structure:

Create a Habit struct to represent a habit with fields like name, creation date, and a map to track completion dates.
User Interface (Text-Based):

Use fmt package for formatted output to display menus, prompts, and habit information.
Leverage scanner package to handle user input for creating habits, marking completions, and viewing history.
Habit Management Functions:

Implement functions for:
Adding a new habit: Prompt for name, store in a slice or map.
Marking a habit as completed for a specific date: Update the habit's completion map.
Viewing habit history: Display list of habits with completion status for a chosen timeframe (e.g., week, month).
Data Persistence (Optional):

Choose a storage method (e.g., JSON files, simple text files).
Implement functions to:
Save habit data to a file upon program exit.
Load habit data from a file upon program startup.
Testing:

Write unit tests to verify the functionality of each habit management function.
Manually test the application's overall flow by adding habits, marking completions, and viewing history.
Further Enhancements:

Add features like setting streaks (consecutive completion days), motivational quotes, or reminders.
Explore integrating with a database for persistent storage and scalability.
Provide a more interactive user interface using a library like cobra for command-line interactions.
